/**
 * @brief Dock, (instead of Mock)
 *
 * It makes more sense to consider creating software in terms of
 * a dock yard, (where great sailing vessels are pieced together)
 * than the word 'Mock'. This appears to be easier on the mind as
 * 'docking software' and 'writing docks for software' sounds so much
 * more constructive than 'mocking software' or 'writing mocks'.
